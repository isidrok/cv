**About me**

I am an engineer with over 8 years of experience. Currently working as a Technical Lead, helping distributed remote teams deliver well-designed software through a mix of hands-on development, collaboration, and guidance.

I’m an expert in JavaScript, Node.js, and Web development, and I partner with engineers, product managers, and designers to align vision and execution—offering architectural advice, mentorship, and a focus on delivery quality.

I am passionate about exploring the inner mechanics of systems and constantly seek to deepen my technical understanding. Currently, I’m also exploring how to integrate AI into my processes to boost efficiency and streamline my workflow.
